I was thinking about starting a blog several times in the last few years. Now I finally decided 
to put this plan to practise. The blog serves mainly as a mnemonic for myself. There are things I keep forgetting over and over. Moreover, I like to try out new things which are best learned by working on a small project. This shall be the place where I document those and know to find it when needed.

Currently I am a PhD Student at University Duisburg-Essen. Before I have studied Economics (BSc)  and Energy and Finance (MSc). My Data Science related interests and hence also topics I want to write about include

- R Programming in general
- Databases 
- Bayesian Statistics 
- Machine Learning
- Spatial and time series models
- Network Science
