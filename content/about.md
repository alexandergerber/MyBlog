My name is Alex and I am a PhD Student at University Duisburg-Essen. I use R for my research projects and also teach classes in econometrics where we work with R. 
</p>
<p>
I was thinking about starting a blog several times in the last few years. Now I finally decided 
to put this plan to practise. I like to try out new things which are best learned by working on a small project.
You will find the results of those here. 
The blog serves mainly as a mnemonic for myself, but maybe you can use any of this for your own work.

<p>
My Data Science related interests and hence also topics I want to write about include:
</p>
<ul>
<li> R Programming in general</li>
<li>Databases</li> 
<li>Econometrics</li>
<li>Bayesian Statistics </li>
<li>Machine Learning</li>
<li>Spatial and time series models</li>
<li>Network Science</li>
</ul>
