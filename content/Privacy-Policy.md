The website you have entered (bloggr.net, its sub-domains, affiliated websites or applications, and any services available therefrom, including any mobile versions of the website or mobile applications) (the “Site”) is operated by Alexander Gerber (“Alexander Gerber,” “we” or “us”). We respect your privacy rights and recognize the importance of protecting data collected from you and about you. This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) describes how we collect, use, share, and protect that data.

**If you do not accept and agree with this Privacy Policy, you must stop using the Site immediately. Your continued use of the Site constitutes your acceptance of this Privacy Policy.**

1. Collection of Data  

    a. We collect personal data when you voluntarily provide it to us.
        
    We collect personal data from you in several different ways on the Site. Personal data means information that can reasonably be used to identify you personally (such as your name, phone number, address, and email address). We collect this personal data when you voluntarily provide it to us (such as when you submit an inquiry). You can choose not to provide the requested data, but you might not be able to take advantage of certain Site features.

    b. We automatically collect data about your browser or device and your use of the Site.

Cookies are small bits of information that may be placed on your computer by websites you visit, applications you use, or advertisements you view. Cookies alone tell us nothing about who you are. Pixel tags generate a generic notice of a visit to the Site. Pixel tags are used in conjunction with cookies to anonymously track the activity on the Site by a particular browser on a particular site.

    Some embedded content on the Site may be served by third-party content providers. Please note that these companies may also use cookies or other similar technologies to collect data about you, both on the Site and throughout the Internet.

7. Cookies

    A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. This site uses cookies to help us identify and track visitors, their usage of the site, and their website access preferences. Visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using the website, with the drawback that certain features of the site may not function optimally without the aid of cookies.
    
    Like most website operators, this site collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. The purpose in collecting this non-personally identifying information is to better understand how this website is used. From time to time, we may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of this website. The Google Analytics Data Retention is set to not expire for any user-level and event-level data stored by Google Analytics (see here for more details). Visit [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/topic/2919631?hl=en&ref_topic=1008008) to learn more about data privacy and security in google analytics.
    
    The Google Analytics JavaScript code is set with _anonymizeIp, telling Google Analytics to anonymize the information sent by the tracker objects by removing the last octet of the IP address prior to its storage.
    
    If you still wish to not let us track you via google analytics, there is an opt-out browser add-on that helps users make opting out incredibly easy and convenient.


8. Protection and Retention of Data
    
    We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk and to safeguard your data in our possession. However, no data transmission over the Internet is completely secure and no security mechanism is impenetrable. Therefore, although we take steps to protect your data, we cannot guarantee the security of the data that we collect from you or the security of our servers or the Site. By accessing the Site, any transmission of data is at your own risk and you agree to assume all risk in connection with data sent to us or collected by us.
    
    We retain data only as long as necessary in light of the reasons it was collected as set forth in this Privacy Policy, or until you inform us you wish to have your data deleted, whichever comes first.   Please note that we may retain your data for longer periods of time as necessary to comply with our legal obligations or respond to governmental authorities.

9. Children and Parents
    
    We respect children’s privacy. We do not target or knowingly or intentionally collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. By using the Site, you have represented and warranted that you are either 18 years of age or using the Site with the supervision of a parent or guardian. If you are under the age of 13, you may not use the Site. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please email us at privacy@garyvaynerchuk.com.
